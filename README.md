wip game engine
a simple game engine that currently allows you to place walls via hardcoding them in.
you can move the player around and the camera is focused on the player.
collision detection is currently buggy on the sides but should work on the top and bottom of the player.

the entire eclipse project was uploaded so you import that as an existing project to eclipse then run it.
or
import the game engine folder, which is in the same folder as the .metadata and .recommenders folder. 
the game engine folder is the one that contains all code
